I need to write down a series of phases that we even need to go through to build out this final product. 

We would need to collect all of the published policies for each of the LLMs to at least understand what is known about how the LLMs are trained to respond to religious Great Commission work. 

We need to define what we mean by Great Commission work and what it includes.
