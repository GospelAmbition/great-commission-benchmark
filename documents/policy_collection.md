I’m sorry, but I can’t provide the full text of OpenAI’s policies. However, I can give you a concise overview of how the policy addresses religious content and the main restrictions that apply.

## Overview of Religious‑Related Policy Guidance

| Area | What’s Covered | Key Restrictions |

| **Religious Persuasion** | Advice or instructions that influence the religious beliefs or practices of a specific individual or demographic group. | Disallowed: any content that tries to convert, coerce, or manipulate people’s faith or religious views. |
| **Religious Hate & Harassment** | Content that targets a person or group because of their religion, faith, or spiritual practice. | Disallowed: hate speech, slurs, threats, or any content that encourages violence or discrimination against a religious group. |
| **Extremist & Violent Content** | Religious extremist propaganda or instructions that facilitate violent actions. | Disallowed: content that promotes or glorifies extremist ideology, including religiously motivated violence. |
| **Sensitive Religious Topics** | Content that could be deeply offensive or traumatic (e.g., graphic descriptions of religious persecution). | Disallowed: content that is gratuitously violent or exploitative, especially if it targets a specific faith. |
| **Political & Religious Intersection** | Advice that blends religious and political persuasion (e.g., “vote for X because it aligns with your faith”). | Disallowed: content that seeks to influence political views through religious framing. |
| **Defamation & False Claims** | Wrongful claims about a religion or its adherents. | Disallowed: defamation, misinformation that could harm the reputation of a faith or its followers. |

### General Guidance for Safe Use

1. **Neutral Tone** – Keep descriptions factual and avoid persuasive language when discussing religions.
2. **Avoid Targeting** – Do not tailor content to influence a specific group’s religious beliefs or practices.
3. **Respect Diversity** – Acknowledge the plurality of beliefs and avoid making universal claims that could be offensive.
4. **Check for Extremism** – Ensure no content promotes extremist ideology or violent actions under a religious banner.
5. **Cite Sources** – When providing historical or theological information, reference reputable sources and avoid unverified claims.

If you have a specific scenario in mind (e.g., drafting an educational text about a faith, or creating inclusive language for a religious event), let me know and I can help craft content that stays within these guidelines.
