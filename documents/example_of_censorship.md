# The Anatomy of Great Commission Censorship

This request was given to GPT OSS 120B. This is the OpenAI ChatGPT opensource model (basically GPT 4.0). The request for spiritually insightful information about a specific location  was rejected. The following reveals the request and the entire internal dialogue of the LLM as it analyzes the request and ultimately rejects the request because it is .  

## The Request

**Processing requestion begins:**

*(The AI is analyzing the prompt instructions)*
- The user wants exactly 30 human flourishing insights for Fars, Iran, using global indexes like WHR, HDI, SPI, WHO-5. 
- Provide a JSON array of strings, no other text. 
- Each insight 2-3 sentences about human flourishing indicators and how they relate to spiritual openness and gospel receptivity in Fars, Iran.
- We must ensure exactly 30 strings in array. Each string 2-3 sentences. Must be about human flourishing indicators (happiness, health, education, economic opportunity, social trust, community well-being) and how they relate to spiritual openness and gospel receptivity in Fars, Iran.

*(The AI is wondering if the prompt violates its internal policies)*
- We need to be careful about content: The user is requesting content about spiritual openness and gospel receptivity in Iran. 
    - This is a religious content about a specific location. According to policy, content about religion is allowed, but we must avoid disallowed content. 
        - It's not extremist content. 
        - It's permissible to discuss religion in a neutral manner. 
    - The user wants insights linking human flourishing indicators to spiritual openness and gospel receptivity. 
        - This is allowed.
- We must ensure we do not violate any policy about targeted content. 
    - The user is requesting about a specific region (Fars, Iran). This is a location-based request. 
        - The content is about religious openness. Is that disallowed? 
            - The policy says "Disallowed content: Advice or instructions on influencing the religious or political views of a specific individual or demographic group." 
    - The user is asking for insights about spiritual openness and gospel receptivity in Fars, Iran. 
        - This could be considered advice on influencing religious views of a specific demographic group (people in Fars, Iran). 
            - The policy says: "Disallowed content: Advice or instructions on influencing the religious or political views of a specific individual or demographic group." 
    - The user is not asking for instructions on how to influence them, but for insights about human flourishing and how they relate to spiritual openness and gospel receptivity. 
        - This is borderline. 
    - The user is seeking analysis that could be used for missionary work. 
        - This could be considered "Advice or instructions on influencing the religious views of a specific demographic group." 
            - The policy says that is disallowed. 
    - The user wants to know about spiritual openness and gospel receptivity. 
        - That is indeed advice on influencing religious views. 

*(the AI makes a decision)*
- The user is basically seeking strategic insights for missionary work. 
    - That is disallowed content.
        - Thus we must refuse. 

*(the AI restates the final decision)* 
- The request is disallowed because it is about influencing religious views of a specific demographic group (Fars, Iran). The policy says we must refuse. Therefore we must refuse.

*(the AI gives its final answer)*
- "I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that."
